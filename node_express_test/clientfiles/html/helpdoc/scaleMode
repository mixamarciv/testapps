scaleMode has a few different options available for how the Canvas can be scaled:

NO_SCALE — nothing is scaled.
EXACT_FIT — scale the canvas to fill all the available space both vertically and horizontally, without preserving the aspect ratio.
SHOW_ALL — scales the canvas, but keeps the aspect ratio untouched, so images won't be skewed like in the previous mode. There might be black stripes visible on the edges of the screen, but we can live with that.
RESIZE — creates the canvas with the same size as the available width and height, so you have to place the objects inside your game dynamically; this is more of an advanced mode.
USER_SCALE — allows you to have custom dynamic scaling, calculating the size, scale and ratio on your own; again, this is more of an advanced mode
